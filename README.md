# Joaquin Gabriel Franco
  
I am a Filipino international student pursuing Nagoya University's G30 Automotive Engineering Program. Currently, I am a student intern at the Fujii Lab (藤井研究室) under Nagoya University's Department of Electrical Engineering. My main interests are image processing and machine learning.    
      
## Project Highlight  
This project was built as part of the G30 Automotive Engineering program, under the Design Practice 2 course. The primary objective was to develop a launcher to launch a ball across an uneven surface and into a designated target net. As part of the project's requirements, a motion tracking and analyzing software was to be built from scratch. The program was written in Python, using the OpenCV and Matplotlib libraries for data collection and visualization.
