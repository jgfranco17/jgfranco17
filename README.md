## About Me  
I am a Filipino international student pursuing Nagoya University's G30 Automotive Engineering Program. I am currently majoring in Mechanical Engineering, with electives in Electronics Engineering. My interests include Python development & machine learning, image processing, and 3D CAD modeling. Currently, I am a student intern at the Fujii Lab (藤井研究室) under Nagoya University's Department of Electrical Engineering. Under the guidance of the professors, I have been studying image processing and data handling with Python and C++, as well as introductory courses to machine learning and deep learning.

## Project Highlight  
This project was built as part of the G30 Automotive Engineering program, under the Design Practice 2 course. The primary objective was to develop a launcher to launch a ball across an uneven surface and into a designated target net. As part of the project's requirements, a motion tracking and analyzing software was to be built from scratch. The program was written in Python, using the OpenCV and Matplotlib libraries for data collection and visualization.
